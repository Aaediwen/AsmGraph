This is a short demo for doing VGA and SVGA graphics in x86 assembly under DOS.  This was purely a sample to investigate what is involved in making it work. 
I thought about making this a full graphics library and writing a GUI API for it, but there are already well established examples of that out there (Win32, GTK, Glib, SDL)
This has served its purpose for me as a sample of how to do assembly language graphics programming on a PC
